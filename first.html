<h3>DOREMON</h3>

<h4>JACKIECHAN ADVENTURES</h4>  
    <p>Jackie Chan is a talented archaeologist who lives in San Francisco with his uncle. His quiet life of exploring booby-trapped castles and dusty tombs is disturbed when an old friend, Captain Black of Section 13, recruits him to stop the Dark Hand from acquiring the 12 Talismans. Having been raised by his Uncle, a powerful Chi Wizard, Jackie understands that the Talismans themselves pose a serious threat to the world, though he often laments that he has been forced onto the frontlines of the battle between good and evil.

            Jackie is a skilled martial artist and is very agile, but would prefer not to fight evil forces unless he has no choice. His catchphrases are "Bad day, bad day, bad day, bad day, BAD DAY!" (usually as a huge understatement), "Talk later!", "I'm sorry, I'll bring it back later, thank you!" (this line has also been used by Uncle and Jade) and "That's crazy, Jade! You're crazy!" When he is in shock or dumbfounded, he makes a strange but quiet whooping sound ("Bwaaah!") similar to Hank Hill of King of the Hill. Though by no means stupid and capable of thinking and acting on his feet to make use of whatever is available in dire situations, he does have a habit of stating the obvious or agreeing to strange requests without realizing until after it has been said.
            
            When Jackie uses the Tiger talisman, he is divided into two different beings: his light self and his dark self. His light side is kind, benevolent, loving, and gentle, yet dimwitted and too sensitive. His dark side is fight-loving, selfish, aggressive and rude, but can be helpful at times. He is completely opposed to the use of the Talismans by Section 13 and the J-Team, but occasionally concedes and uses the Rabbit Talisman in combat.</p>

<h5>LITTLE KRISHNA</h5>
         <p>Who is Krishna? Krishna is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In Bhagavad-gita Krishna declares: Whenever and wherever there is a decline in dharma (religious practice) and a predominant rise of adharma (irreligion), at that time Krishna descends to protect the pious and to annihilate the miscreants. Thus He appears millennium after millennium to reestablish the principles of religion.

            Five thousand years ago, Krishna appeared in the village of Vrindavana and performed various pastimes to give pleasure to His devotees. He also killed various demons who were trying to disturb the innocent people of Vrindavana. The uncommon activities of Sri Krishna are divine and even great sages like Narada glorify these transcendental acts. Devotees are always eager to hear about the adventurous pastimes of the Lord in His various incarnations, especially the superhuman acts He performed in the forests of Vrindavana, along with His elder brother Balarama.
            
            The pastimes of Little Krishna are recorded in Srimad Bhagavatam and are also expounded in various other literatures written by the gosvamis of Vrindavana. A team of devotees from ISKCON Bangalore, headed by Sri Chanchalapati Dasa, worked for seven years and the result of their research work is this 13-episode animated series on selected pastimes of Krishna. Emmy-award winning animation writer Jeffrey Scott wrote the script. The episodes are narrated in a manner, engrossing enough to mesmerize the audience world over, and leave them spell-bound.
